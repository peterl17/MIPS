to make myself feel better I like to antagonize animals:

Tell people im a vegatarian to gain trust and then eat them.
Show elephants videos of war crimes and they have to be sad for the rest of their lives.
Follow squirrels storing nuts and replace them with mines. one winter later, boom. no one suspects me. clean getaway.
use a sonic whistle to give bats wrong directions.
buy flammingos a shoe but for the foot that they don't stand on. gives no barrier of protection between its foot and the ground.
play busta rhymes songs to parrots
go out of my way to bring invasive species to new lands and watch species get pushed to extinction. 
give rogane to bald eagles. 
give monkies diarhea so they have nothing to throw. no ammunition.
brand cows with eat pray love so they have to walk around with this stupid phrase on them.
pelt skittles at black people. 
adopt puppies and take them to the pound across town. /and put them down myself
force lions to eat tofu
